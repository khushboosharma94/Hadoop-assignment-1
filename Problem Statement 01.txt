Problem Statement 01 :


Working with HDFS Commands

1. Create a folder in HDFS by name “dir01” and move input1.txt , input2.txt and input3.txt into
/dir01.

Ans: hdfs dfs -mkdir /user/khushboouser1/dir01
hdfs dfs -ls

2. List only the file names present in “/dir01”

Ans: hdfs dfs -put input1.txt input2.txt input3.txt /user/khushboouser1/dir01/
hdfs dfs -ls /user/khushboouser1/dir01/


3. Change the replication factor for the content present in directory “/dir01” to 5 and display
the replication factor for the files present in “/dir01”.

Ans:Change replication factor for dir01 content to 5
hdfs dfs -setrep 5 /user/khushboouser1/dir01/*


4. Create a folder in HDFS by name “scenario01” and create directory “level01” inside
“scenario01” directory and create another directory “level02” inside directory “level01”.
Once the required directories are created copy input1.txt to scenario01, input2.txt to level01
and input3.txt to level02 and finally recursively print only the file names present in
directory scenario01
/user/naveen/scenario01/input1.txt
/user/naveen/scenario01/level01
/user/naveen/scenario01/level01/input1.txt
/user/naveen/scenario01/level01/level02
/user/naveen/scenario01/level02
/user/naveen/scenario01/level03


Create scenario01 and level01/level02 directories
hdfs dfs -mkdir -p /user/khushboouser1/scenario01/level01/level02
 
# Copy files to respective directories
hdfs dfs -put input1.txt /user/khushboouser1/scenario01/
hdfs dfs -put input2.txt /user/khushboouser1/scenario01/level01/
hdfs dfs -put input3.txt /user/khushboouser1/scenario01/level01/level02/
 
# Recursively print file names in scenario01
 
hdfs dfs -ls  /user/khushboouser1/scenario01/
